# SpaceBar
It's a bar... in spaaace. 

We make the best potions in the sector and our space wizard clientele sure loves to drink. Your mission is to traverse the asteroids and bring back the raw ingredients for our potions. 

- explore the asteroids
- find rare materials
- don't explode

## Gameplay
Your new job as a forrager wizard starts out easy but quickly ramps up from gathering ice to mining explodium and stealing eggs from the jumping asteroid spiders over in sector 13. 

You have very little fuel for propulsion, but you can move by tethering to asteroids as you pass by. Your tether pulls you along and lets you swing around. It can also pull materials from whatever you're attached to. 

This is a semi-[roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) inspired by Asteroids, Pinball, Spiderman, [Noita](https://noitagame.com/), all the sci-fi books that feature space wizards, and the [Pirate Software game jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate15) that got me started with the theme "Shadows and Alchemy".
